	<p>The Museum of Design in Atlanta, or MODA, is the only museum in the southeast dedicated to the celebration of all things design. In my limited experience with the museum, they’ve always had interesting, thought-provoking, and relevant exhibitions that are well curated. This weekend, I visited their current exhibition called Design for Good: Architecture for Everyone.</p>

<p>This exhibit was curated by John Cary, and architect himself, who focuses on design and philanthropy. He has put together an exhibition that features architecture from around the world that focuses on fostering a sense of belonging. It was communicated that design was commonly seen as a luxury—a province of the rich—and that can’t be an acceptable way to think about it anymore. The small gallery features a series of case studies that focused on examples of ways that could fulfill this promise.</p>

<p>One building that stood out to me was Baitur Rauf Jame Mosque that was designed by the architect Marina Tabassum. The building is located on the edge of Dhaka, Bangladesh—in an area that does not have many communal amenities—and does not look like a typical mosque. There are no minarets, there is no dome. It is purely a humble brick monolith that sits on the corner of two dirt streets. It’s low to the ground, with long tread entrance steps inviting one to linger - sit, congregate.</p>

<p>Once inside, the perforated brick walls guide the visitor into a large atrium that acts as a space for prayer and reflection - but also as a school, meeting room, and a playground. Tabassum’s idea was to strip away the idea of a mosque to it’s core, and to “let go of all the extra liturgies that are associated with those things”. This has enabled the neighborhood to truly have a communal space to claim as their own that is non-intimidating and open to all.</p>

<p>Utilizing the same concept of using architecture as a way to help build community is the Women’s Opportunity Center designed by Sharon Davis Design. This series of structures is located in Kayonza, Rwanda and is focused on teaching women income-generating skills like animal husbandry, processing techniques that can sustain food cooperatives. Like the mosque, these buildings are also constructed of brick due to it’s source material being abundant locally, but the key difference here is that the women of the community helped construct the buildings too. It truly is a project built by the people it services and it improved the workers’ skillsets in hand-on construction administration.</p>

<p>According to the architect’s website,</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>“the buildings center on an inviting, publicly accessible plaza where students sell food, textiles, baskets, and other products made on site. Potable water is collected from the pavilions’ corrugated roofs, while vegetation planted on two of the structures provides their interiors with extra insulation.”
It really is built by and for the community it serves and is an interesting way to think about design in a general sense.</p>

<p>It’s interesting to think about how these concepts can affect graphic design. In some ways we see it everyday with social networking applications. Content being created by users for other users to consume. The real difference is that as much as the networks themselves would like to advertise that they are building community, we have come to the realization that it’s really a guise to sell our personal information for for profit.</p>

<p>It is amazing to see what a genuine community building spirit can accomplish when applied to designing solutions for others. This can not only be applied to architecture, but graphic design could benefit from this thinking as well.</p>
