World Finance (Nasdaq: WRLD) was founded in 1963 and last updated their mission and values in the 1980s. After 40 years, the company had gone through a cultural shift that led to focusing on the growth of people over profit – this included customers as well as team members. Annual engagement surveys had led to World Finance earning a national Top Workplaces award two years in a row, and the senior executive team decided it was time to develop a new set of mission and values that reflected the sentiment.

## Teaser video and  a tangible launch experience.

We wanted to make an impression on the 3,000 person team so we went after multiple senses in the rollout. We created a series of teaser videos to peak everyone’s interest. The video above is an example of one of three videos that were released in the weeks leading up to the launch. On the day the initiative was revealed – we made sure that everyone in the company had gift boxes full of merchandise that reflected the new values.

## Launch video and and future recruiting.

We created a video in collaboration with the head of HR, the CEO, and the COO. The primary purpose of the video was to announce the new Mission and Values initiative. We also shot it in a way that it could be used in recruitment materials as well. It’s shown to every group on new hires in the company, as well as featured on a newly redesigned careers section of the website (below).
