Snapscout is a location scouting app for photographers, and anyone else that may want to save the locations of great shots. I wanted the name to be self-evident. In a marketplace where app findability is governed by Google and App Store searches, it's always a good idea to convey what the app does in the name itself. 

Clarity and quick comprehension are primary design features, and have been carefully considered when designing the identity, mobile app, and the marketing touch points. I've documented the research and design process below with the end result being a hi-fi functioning prototype.

## Research and ideation
The images above and the ones below show the ideation and iteration of the logo, tone, and color of the brand. Old world travel, maps, badges, and cameras make up the majority of the mood.

## Resolved Brand Identity
The next image showcases the resolved identity. Using Archer as the primary typeface lends a playfulness to the brand and contrasts nicely with the hard edges of the camera icon. San Francisco pairs well with Archer's slab-serif, and is the default typeface for the iPhone-which will significantly lighten the load of the app. The icon is simple, speaks directly to the function of the app, and is still unique.

## User experience research and functionality
The app has been distilled down to three major functions: Storage of scouted locations, organization of those locations, and sharing those locations with a community of like-minded people. Some unique features that the app will provide will be the ability to see other people's lists of locations, as well as subscribing to other user's location feeds.

The next images are some of the wireframes that were designed for planning the user experience and prototyped for user testing.

## User interface and prototype
The hi-fi prototype and fully-realized interface is featured below. The next step is finding a mobile app developer who likes photography as much as I do. <a href="https://invis.io/ESJ0RR3QPG3" target="_blank">Try out the prototype here</a>.
