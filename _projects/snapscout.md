Snapscout is a location scouting app for photographers, and anyone else that may want to save the locations of great shots. I wanted the name to be self-evident. In a marketplace where app findability is governed by Google and App Store searches, it's always a good idea to convey what the app does in the name itself. 

Clarity and quick comprehension are primary design features, and have been carefully considered when designing the identity, mobile app, and the marketing touch points. I've documented the research and design process below with the end result being a hi-fi functioning prototype.

## We reinforced our word-of-mouth efforts through tangible touchpoints.
The Iron Yard was a school, albeit non-traditional. Students and team members were proud to be a part of this new type of education system. We created an online store that sold TIY swag at cost so that everyone could own all of the items that they wanted. We even did limited release seasonal colors of the shirts. Think of it like a start-up style college bookstore.
