## Consistency in execution

The initial need was to audit the existing marketing touch points and formulate brand guidelines that could be used as a reference from that point on. Once the guide was created, the design team worked on developing collateral that followed the new system and also reflected the values that the company had come to embrace. These values included diversity and inclusiveness in the workforce, an entrepreneurial mindset, and an authentic tone that exuded trustworthiness and grit.

## We reinforced our word-of-mouth efforts through tangible touchpoints.
The Iron Yard was a school, albeit non-traditional. Students and team members were proud to be a part of this new type of education system. We created an online store that sold TIY swag at cost so that everyone could own all of the items that they wanted. We even did limited release seasonal colors of the shirts. Think of it like a start-up style college bookstore.
