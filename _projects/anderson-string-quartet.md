The Anderson String Quartet has been a staple in the upstate of South Carolina and northeast Georgia since 1972. They play for weddings, church services, and special events. The quartet was looking for a new identity that would reflect their classical repertoire
but also be distinct and long lasting.

A mark was created that is made up of four pegs and four dotsâ€”representing the four instruments, and the four musicians
respectively. The colors chosen are a simple black and white, relying on the texture of the substrate and imagery to bring diversity to printed and digital compositions. Caslon Pro was chosen because it was designed in the time period of Joseph Haydn, the father of the string quartet.
